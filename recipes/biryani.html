        <h4>Chicken biryani is a delicious Pakistani/Indian rice dish that's typically reserved for special occasions such as weddings, parties, or holidays such as Ramadan. It has a lengthy preparation, but the work is definitely worth it. For biryani, basmati rice is the ideal variety to use.</h4>
        
        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound basmati rice</li>
            <li>4 cups of chicken stock</li>
            <li>3 pounds boneless, skinless chicken pieces cut into chunks.</li>
            <li>Turmeric</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons of plain yogurt</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
            <li>Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a large skillet. Fry potatoes in hot oil until lightly browned, about 3 to 5 minutes. Remove to a paper towel-lined plate to drain; set aside.</li>
            <li>Add remaining 2 tablespoons of oil to the skillet. Add onions, garlic, and fresh ginger; cook and stir until onion is soft and golden. Add tomatoes, salt, cumin, chili powder, pepper, and turmeric; cook, stirring constantly, for 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Layer the lasagna according to the recipe instructions.</li>
            <li>Stir in yogurt, mint, ground cardamom, and cinnamon stick. Cover and cook over low heat, stirring occasionally, until tomatoes are cooked to a pulp. It may be necessary to add a little hot water if mixture becomes too dry and starts to stick to the pan.</li>
            <li>Add chicken and stir well to coat. Cover and cook over very low heat until chicken is tender, 35 to 45 minutes. There should only be a little very thick gravy left when chicken is finished cooking. If necessary cook uncovered for a few minutes to reduce the gravy.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a large skillet. Add onion; cook and stir until golden. Add cardamom pods, cloves, cinnamon stick, ground ginger, and saffron; stir in rice until coated with spices.</li>
            <li>Heat stock and salt in a medium pot until hot; pour over rice and stir well.</li>
            <li>Add chicken mixture and potatoes; stir gently to combine. Bring to a boil.</li>
        </ol>
